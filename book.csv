"Apple Rolls Out New ‘Adult’ Emojis In Attempt to Prevent Teens from Sexting With Real Photos
In an apparent bid to stop teenage sexting, Apple plans on rolling out a new range of raunchy emojis, displaying various sex acts. The move comes after a scandal at an elementary school in Wisconsin, where nude photos of school goers landed up on Facebook, sparking shame and outcry.“It’s for the safety of the kids. As adults we know how dangerous it is for us to make compromising pictures available, but children don’t realize it could come back to haunt them,” said one Apple executive. “Since promoting abstinence has not made a significant difference, we’re now implementing new ways of practicing safe sexting.”In order to make the range as relevant as possible, the new emojis will feature, in addition to a huge variety of homo- and heterosexual acts, genitalia of three different sizes – small, medium and large.“We want them to be personal,” said project manager, Brian McAlly. “A boy with a small penis, sending to a girl with a large vagina, cannot be sending a picture of a large member penetrating a tight hole. That won’t do for him – he wants the girl to see as accurate a representation of his junk as possible, and visualize her orifice as realistically as possible.”Parents have been unanimous in their support of the move. At a recent PTA meeting at a school in New York, parental rep Molly Gingrich announced the group’s satisfaction at the development.“When I saw Jimmy’s penis on my Anna’s phone, I got the shock of my life,” she said to shouts of agreement. “He has a hideous dick, which subsequently ended up on Tumblr. And I worried that my daughter’s ugly vagina might share the same fate. It might ruin her chances of having the busy sex life I know she doesn’t deserve.”The teaching body, however, disagreed.“I’ve said it once and I’ll say it again,” principal John Skinner pronounced. “Sexting is part of regular teenage behavior. It should not be reduced into tiny representations of dirty coitus. My colleagues and I often keep tabs on the images that are making the rounds, and have seen nothing wrong in them. If anything, our students do a good job at photographing their junk from the most flattering angle possible.”At press time, parents were browsing some of the teachers’ favorites, and had agreed that actually, they can be proud of the publicity of their children’s’ genitals.",tech_s
"Texas to Pass “Name Your Fetus” Bill
State legislators in Texas will vote on an anti-abortion bill that some opponents are saying is “the most draconian law” in Texas’ history, as it makes abortions significantly more challenging for women to obtain.  But despite their protests, analysts are now saying the bill will likely overwhelmingly pass when it’s up for vote on June 16th. The “Right to Life Act of 2014,” which has taken on the nickname of “the name your fetus bill,” was proposed last year by Texas State Senator and local Tea Party favorite Dennis Kilmeade (R).  If passed, it would mandate that women seeking an abortion must not only hear their fetus’ heartbeat, but must also come up with male and female baby names, speak with at least one faculty member from the local school district, and examine no fewer than 30 baby photos. But what’s arguably the most heatedly-debated rule?  The woman would also be required to write her excuse for getting the abortion, and submit it to a judge.  While the judge cannot decide the woman’s fate, he or she can, at their sole discretion, pass the letter on to the county clerk, with orders to publish the woman’s name, photo, and the name of her fetus on a website. The bill has been quietly debated in closed sessions in Texas’ capital building for months.  Democrats fervently opposed it, and hold barely enough seats to filibuster the vote.  But reports indicate the Democratic Party leadership caved in April after Republicans made a number of concessions in the bill, stripping away a mandatory night in jail, a ban on welfare benefits, and mandated attendance at church services. Local Democrats are not pleased.  “This is one of the most ridiculous laws I’ve ever heard of.  How the Democrats could cave like this is beyond anyone,” said abortion doctor Alison Ames of Galveston, Texas.  “Come on… mandatory jail time?  Forced church attendance?  Have these people read the Constitution?  This is absurd.” But Republicans are adamant their law is a game changer.  “This could spread nationally, once people see the success we’ll have with the law,” Kilmeade claimed during a recent interview with Fox News.  “At the end of the day, this is an honest Christian nation with good Christian morals and values.  It’s not our fault if some people fail to see that and let the devil between their legs.  We can’t ban abortion, but this is the next best thing.  And these women will all be happier for it, they’ll see that in the end.”",pol_s
"Kate Middleton denies palace tryst
The royals are not above showing a little of their majestic bodies on occasion. Exhibitionist Kate Middleton, Duchess of Cornhole and wife of Prince William, is proof of that, having shown her regal tatas to the world and having flashed her panties in public on more than a few occasions. However, Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II apparently frowns on mere commoners showing off their naughty bits, especially when the commoner in question is male and he's climbing down a bed sheet tied to furniture in the boudoir where her grandson \""sleeps with\"" the duchess. \""What was the bloke doing there, anyway?\"" one of the palace guards asked. \""I mean, he's naked, but for his left sock, and he's climbing out Kate's window when William is out of town. It seems suspect to me.\"" The queen suggested that the guard should \""keep his vulgar opinions to himself\"" unless he wants to visit the royal executioner in the Tower of London. All went well for the climber for ten feet or so, and then the man lost his grip, perhaps as a result of encountering semen, and plummeted twenty feet to the ground below. Buckingham Palace staunchly denies that the incident ever happened, despite the capture of the naked man's exploits on video, and police say no one has yet reported an injured or dead man on or near the palace. \""It's a hoax, most likely,\"" the duchess opined, \""for I would never frolic naked with anyone else but William, unless I were sunbathing au naturale in France or was walking down the street in a short skirt on a windy day.\"" Besides, although Kate is herself a commoner, she says \""I'm not common enough to sleep with a commoner.\"" Reportedly, however, Her Majesty is having the palace's locks changed and has ordered the royal seamstress to sew weights to the hems of the duchess' skirts. She may also have Kate \""fumigated.\""",ent_s

"Medical marijuana bill gains momentum in Senate
A push to legalize medical marijuana at the federal level is gaining momentum in the Senate, drawing a growing roster of co-sponsors from both parties just over a week after it was unveiled. Though 23 states have legalized medical marijuana, the federal government classifies pot as a Schedule I narcotic, recognizing no appropriate medical uses for the drug. The Compassionate Access, Research Expansion, and Respect States (CARERS) Act, introduced last Tuesday by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand, D-New York, Cory Booker, D-New Jersey, and Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, would reclassify marijuana as a Schedule II drug, providing dispensaries in states that permit medical marijuana with access to the banking system and potentially fueling greater medical research of the drug. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, signed onto the proposal last week, declaring in a statement, ""The time has come for the federal government to stop impeding the doctor-patient relationship in states that have decided their own medical marijuana policies.""""This bipartisan legislation puts Americans who are suffering first by allowing Nevada's medical marijuana patients, providers, and businesses that are in compliance with state law, to no longer be in violation of federal law and vulnerable to federal prosecution,"" he said. Heller's release noted that the bill would also allow doctors at Department of Veterans Affairs to prescribe medical marijuana as a form of treatment in states that allow it. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-California, threw her support behind the measure on Wednesday. ""Senator Boxer is a strong supporter of California's medical marijuana law and she believes that patients, doctors and caregivers in states like California should be able to follow state law without fear of federal prosecution,"" Zachary Coile, Boxer's communications director, said in a statement. Boxer's fellow Californian, Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein, is on the fence about the proposal. She told Roll Call she remains concerned about the potency of some types of marijuana, and she'd like to see greater research into derivatives of the drug that provide the medical benefits but not the psychoactive effects. ""I think states can do what states can do. I think the federal law is another thing, and, you know I just hate to see this because there's marijuana, then there's marijuana,"" Feinstein said. ""There's very strong marijuana, and there's marijuana that isn't. And then there's marijuana that may be medically beneficial, and this is what we are trying to pursue."" As the bill gains steam, it still faces an uphill battle to passage in a Republican-dominated Congress. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, is opposed to the measure, and he has said he's unlikely to schedule it for a hearing.""It's a matter of what are our priorities,"" Grassley told Roll Call. The senator said President Obama's recent comment that Congress could reclassify the drug if enough states decriminalize it ""absolutely won't"" affect his decision. At least one Republican on Grassley's committee, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, wasn't so sure. ""I think it does increase the pressure,"" Flake told Roll Call about Obama's suggestion. ""He's probably right...if you get to a majority of the states that are doing it, then people are going to say, 'What's Congress going to do? How can these states act in ways that are not congruent with federal law?'""",pol_t
"Apple Founder Steve Jobs Found Alive, Hiding Out In Jamaica
A set of tourists were shocked to see a man who looked suspiciously like one of their idols on the beaches of Rio Bueno, Jamaica. Jake Nestar and Stacey Kenely, who are self-proclaimed Apple fanatics, were enjoying the sun and sand of Jamaica when they noticed a man who looked suspiciously like Apple Founder Steve Jobs. On further investigation, the two realized it was, in fact, the long-thought dead Jobs, and celebrated with such gusto that they blew the entrepreneur’s cover.“We were just so excited to see the man who changed our lives so much,” said Nester. “I was like, ‘Babe, is that him?’ and she was all ‘Jake, you’re high.’ But I was pretty sure. Then she started looking up pictures of him on her iPad. Then she was all ‘OMG, Babe, that’s him.’ He was the dude.”According to onlookers, Nester then ran up to Jobs, bragging about his new Apple products. The outburst caught the attention of some other tourists. Quickly, a mob formed around Jobs, and within minutes, news reporters were on the scene.With his cover blown, Jobs had no choice but to speak on the matter.“I was simply trying to enjoy my life,” the marketing genius said. “I had come to the beach thinking it was low season for tourists. I didn’t think anyone would recognize me.”Jobs then explained his reason for the faked death. “I was under so much stress the last decade. I knew the only way people would stop constantly hassling me for ideas was if they thought I was dead. Do you have any idea how nice it is to not own personal electronic products? I’ve been free ever since the world stopped bothering me.”The Apple founder did seem to have a relaxed and calm demeanor when speaking to reporters. The Island lifestyle did seem to agree with his new want in life.“Nobody cares who I am down here. Nobody wants to bother me about what the new innovation or strategy will be. They just enjoy sitting and chatting, smoking weed or drinking rum. We all go down to the weekly Tupac and Biggie concerts and enjoy life without computers, cell phones, pads, pods, and other devices that suck the life out of you.”When asked if he had any remorse about unveiling Job’s secret, Nester replied, “Did he say Tupac and Biggie concerts?”",tech_s
"Timbuktu' director wants more cinema from West Africa
The Oscar nomination of ""Timbuktu"", a film about the occupation of the Malian desert town by al Qaeda-linked Islamists in 2012, should not mask the lack of established cinema from West Africa, its director said.Up for the Best Foreign Language Film at Sunday's ceremony, Abderrahmane Sissako's film has already won two awards at this year's Cannes Film Festival and seven at the Cesar Award's, France's equivalent of the Oscars.It tells how residents in the ancient town, which has a rich history as a seat of Islamic learning, resisted the harsh Islamic law imposed by militants, whose decrees ranged from bans on music and football to stoning those accused of adultery.Despite being home to FESPACO, a biennial film festival held in Burkina Faso, and Nollywood, Nigeria's cinema industry that churns out hundreds of films every years, Sissako called for West African leaders to do to more to promote regional film making    ""Being nominated is great for the continent and Mauritania ... (But) You cannot say that cinema is established because there is a festival,"" Sissako told Reuters, speaking from the United States.""When you have countries that produce one film a year or one film every three years, which is the reality of African nations, cinema is not well established,"" he said.Sissako was born in Mauritania but spent some of his school years in Mali. Based in France, much of his work focuses on Africa and issues from across the continent.""Timbuktu"" was shot in the eastern deserts of Mauritania, near the border with Mali, where the Islamists were scattered in early 2013 by a French military intervention but there are still sporadic attacks as militants mount a resurgence.Sissako's crew received protection from Mauritania's security forces but he said that cinema, and culture in general, was still delegated to being a secondary issue for governments across in the region.""There is a lack of political vision in nearly all the countries,"" he said. ""Wherever there is no culture it is not a good thing.""His film highlights defiant individuals and the contradictions of the Islamists.An imam argues against the interpretation of Islam imposed by the mix of foreign and local gunmen. A woman fishseller refuses to wear gloves, as requested. Boys play a football match with an imaginary ball as the sport has been banned.Meanwhile, one Islamist secretly smokes a cigarette behind a sand dune while others debate the skills of top footballers.The resistance ordinary Malians show in the film highlights how, culturally, West African societies largely reject the form of Islam espoused by extremists.""We have to be clear - the salafists are a step backwards for society,"" Sissako said. ""This is not something that we can resolve in two years. It is much more complex than that."" ""You should not minimize what NATO did in Libya. This was a major factor yet there has been a silence over this,"" he said, referring to the West's support for rebels who ousted the late leader Muammar Gaddafi.",ent_t
"Will Self claims he could have written Kate Bush’s songs – ‘only better’‏
Having already dismissed George Orwell’s contributions to twentieth century literature, as ‘mediocre’, Mr. Self has humbly explained why other artistic icons are not worthy to be considered a genius. To this end, the 6′ 5″ Playboy journalist has announced his plans to tour with an album of his own compositions and prove that he is ‘…the greatest female singer-songwriter of his generation’. Author of nine novels and two pop-up books, Mr. Self has made very few forays into the music world but has explored enough drugs to ‘…have written ten Sgt. Pepper’s!’ In deconstructing the back catalogue of Kate Bush, Mr. Self was dismissive of her work: ‘All you need to do is flail your arms around while wearing a leotard, making fatuous literary allusions. Well, I’ve been doing that last part for years. How hard can it be to find a unitard in my size?’ While Kate Bush has garnered rave reviews for her current stage show and has eight albums in the Official UK Albums Chart simultaneously, only Mr. Self can claim to have made Ulrika Jonsson smile with a ‘…terribly clever pun’. His agent confirmed. ‘Bush is overrated. Her album covers are too obvious. Will is going down a much more artistic route. Something like Sting’s semi-naked photo – you know the one – him, holding a lute while his wife does yoga. Classy. None of that hippy-trippy stuff. A bit of culture. Will brews his own coffee, smokes a pipe and takes long meaningful walks. He’s a proper musician. None of that dicking around with instruments’. One Rock n’ Roll historian commented: ‘Ms Bush has shunned publicity, while Mr. Self is an actual television personality – with gravitas, a sophisticated monotone and the face of Chris Langham. You’re nobody unless you’re on a panel show. It was only a matter of time until he eclipsed all other artists. And he’s already penned a Bush homage – ‘The Man with his Head up his Arse’.",ent_s

"EPA, President Obama Seek To Outlaw Gasoline, Diesel Engines In Automobiles
 For over a century, Americans have been getting from place to place by relying on crude oil and fossil fuels. You might say that it is a part of our culture; gas guzzling hot rods and slicked back hair have given way to gas guzzling Hummers and slicked back hair.  But now, a new emergency legislation, penned by a group of up-and-comers at the EPA, will make gasoline engines a thing of the past.EPA Special Studies Chairman, Akiko Kim, explained the need for the new law in a largely ignored Congressional Hearing back in October of this year.“You have all these midlife crisis Corvettes, and these Over-Testosteroned off-road trucks out there, just belching carbon into the air. These people are Mongoloids. They are killing their own children and they don’t even care,” said Kim. “There is no accountability. I wish we could put them all in FEMA camps. Sadly, we can’t, so the next best thing should be done, and that is to take away their toys in an attempt to destroy the life they lead.”The law would see all cars that do not pass emissions tests (including classics, which have been exempt up to this point) impounded if they are operated on public property. This new ruling would start in July 2015, the start of the government’s fiscal calendar. The auto industry would also be banned from releasing any further gasoline models.Kim thinks it is a good start. ”These rich guys just cruising around in their classic gas guzzlers are gonna get a wake up call. And these automakers who have been killing us for years will find themselves out of business if they do not adapt. Electric and alternative-fuel vehicles are the way of the future, and they should rapidly become the way of the present, too.”“I don’t care ’bout them fuckin’ tree huggers,” said long-time diesel enthusiast Joe Lee Roberts. “I’ll roll coal on the EPA lawn, and if they don’t like it, we can schedule a second amendment meeting.”President Obama, who is known to be an avid supporter of all things environmentally friendly, is expected to sign the bill into law after the Christmas holiday break.",pol_s
"Man with IOS7 walking around office like he owns the place
32 year-old office worker Simon Williams is walking around the office showing off IOS 7 on his iPhone 5 like he Goddamn owns the place, according to reports this morning. After a frantic evening involving a three-hour download and multiple failed installs, Williams is telling anyone who’ll listen how wonderful his life now is. “Yeah, I just installed it and now I’ve got it,” he told Sharon, the new receptionist. “And if I make a mistake doing anything, all I have to do is shake the device. Which is cool, as I do a lot of that.” Others in the office have pretended to be busy when approached by Williams, for fear of hearing how he can now add filters to his photos like everyone else has been doing for the last two years. Account Manager Dave Smith said he’d been approached by Williams twice already this morning over some pretence that he needed to show him how Siri was organising his dairy. He told us, “I mean, he’s a junior accountant for God’s sake, his diary is filled with ‘put more stuff into spreadsheets’.  You don’t need a virtual assistant for that.” “And like I told him, IOS7 won’t get him a girlfriend.” Williams concluded, “Yes, but look at this, I can turn off wifi with a swipe of my finger.”",tech_s
"Republican Congress Passes Bill to Landmine Mexican Border
The Republican House and Senate passed a bill today that would line the Mexican-American border with over 1.2 million PMZ-40 landmines. The bill, officially named the Patriotic American Protection Act (PAPA), will place three landmines every 10 feet across the entire 1,989-mile Mexican-American border. “Explosives are cheaper and more effective than a wall,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told The Washington Times-Picayune. “Building a two thousand mile long wall was unrealistic to begin with. The landmines make much more sense. “This strategy will also show us where the immigrants are attempting to enter the country and we can fortify those areas with extra explosives. It will certainly make them think twice before attempting to enter the country illegally.” At $75 per landmine, labor and maintenance would be a fraction of the cost of building a 20-foot wall along the border. Sensors will also detect when a mine has been detonated so it can be replaced easily by a skeleton maintenance crew. “We’ll be getting the biggest bang for our buck,” said McConnell. Texas governor and potential 2016 presidential candidate Rick Perry championed the bill, telling the Cowboy Gazette, “The good things about land mines is that they can take out adults and children. “After people come home with some missing limbs, there'll get the point and stop trying to enter the US. The word of mouth about the land mines will go ‘viral’ as the kids say.” Perry has fought for tougher immigration reform, as his state has the longest stretch of land bordering Mexico and therefore the most landmines. Perry voiced his approval to the Gazette. “We’ll have the most landmines in the western hemisphere. It’s a proud day to be a Texan.” The Ottawa Treaty, which made land mines illegal since 1999, was signed by 162 nations including the United Kingdom, Canada, and Mexico. The United States has failed to ratified the treaty. United Nations Peace Officer Pete Sakes told The New York Times, “We, as humans, banned landmines because of their ferocious nature. They lay in the ground until someone steps on one. We have been diligently removing landmines across the world, and now the U.S. wishes to line their border with them. They are not setting a good example to countries whom we are constantly trying to convince not to set landmines.” Other human rights groups have voiced their dissent regarding the “Mexican Repellent” bill. People Of Peace president Gwyneth McCarthy told the Times, “I’m shocked. I’d rather see them build that damn wall then place landmines, the only purpose of which is to kill innocent women and children. “The United States needs to grow up. I’m positive President Obama will veto the bill, but to imagine he has the choice is scary as Hell. If it was up to me, I’d place a landmine up those Republican asses.”",pol_s

"California struggles to conserve what little water that's left
In the midst of a historic drought, California imposed new restrictions Tuesday on water use. State regulators voted to outlaw watering lawns more than twice a week, and within 48 hours of a rain storm. Restaurants can only serve water if customers request it.Almost all of California, 93 percent, is facing ""severe"" drought. In 67 percent of the state, it's ""extreme."" The March measurement of the snow pack in California's Sierra Nevada Mountains came just after a fresh snowfall.But that couldn't hide the fact that after the driest January on record, the state's reservoirs may hold just one year's water supply.""It makes for scenic photographs, but really has minimal impact in terms of water supply,"" says Frank Gehrke of the California Department of Water Resources Well drillers in the state have been busy.Steve Arthur has had farmers lined up for one of his half-dozen rigs, which aren't finding water until 1,000 or 1,200 feet below ground. ""From this job site, we go up the road here about a mile and half, we got another thousand-footer,"" Arthur says. The need for deeper wells adds to worry that the water table under the Central Valley is being depleted.Dairy farmer Joey Airosa depends on well water to grow feed for his 2,700 cows.He's worried that there will come a time that no matter how deep he drills, he won't be able to pump up water.""I think everybody's worried about that,"" Airosa says.NASA water scientist Jay Famiglietti uses a satellite to measure the drought.

"Ted Cruz Blames Obama For Rosetta UK Space Mission
Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) along with officials at NASA headquarters expressed muted praise for the UK’s historic Rosetta space mission success. “Obama said an achievement like this would be our victory, but once again, his lofty language resulted in failure. He was way off the mark.” The Texas senator referred to Obama’s 2010 pledge made to NASA’s during a Kennedy Space Center speech in Florida, promising an asteroid probe project, similar to the success achieved this week by the United Kingdom. The Rosetta mission succeeded, for the first time in history, in executing a controlled landing of a space probe onto a moving target, monitored and controlled from more than 310 million miles from Earth. “Thanks to Obama’s massive budget cuts to NASA,” said Cruz, “the inspiration our young people once held for space exploration, science and math is now non-existent. He’s set us back to the 1950s when we lost the space race to Russia. We are no longer moving forward.” European Space Agency scientists jumped for joy when data received from the Philae probe confirmed the spacecraft’s landing on the surface of comet 67P. NASA spokesperson John Phillips said “Of course we congratulate our European colleagues.” Many scientists, physicists, and engineers decided to leave NASA and work in the UK when the once dominant NASA fell victim to democrat backed budget cuts in 2013. “Leaving NASA and heading to Europe was a hard decision to make,” added Phillips. “Many of us started out at the space agency, but each year we had less and less budget to work with so we moved. Opportunities that are better for research and space exploration now exist outside the United States. It’s unfortunate but that’s the reality.” Chiming in on the predicament faced by NASA, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said “I’ve said this so many times I sound like a broken record – ‘leading from behind.’ Obama’s policies have gotten us into trouble all around the world, not only militarily, but educationally and technologically. What do we tell our kids now, go out and learn a trade? Even there, jobs are gone. Just look at the numbers. It’s a disaster.” Whether the success now being enjoyed by European Space Agency scientists will spark renewed interest and investment into our US space program is doubtful. Said Sen. Cruz, “We had our chance and Obama blew it. Congress tried hard to keep money in the program, but that wasn’t on the President’s agenda. He got what he wanted and all I keep thinking about is that old show when I was a kid: Lost In Space. But now thanks to Obama, it’s not just one family that’s lost – it’s all the American people who are lost.”",pol_s
"Studio Admits ‘American Sniper’ Is Propaganda Film; Movie Was Commissioned By U.S. Government
 Warner Bros. Entertainment, in an announcement that surprised no one, admitted Wednesday that their box office hit, American Sniper, was actually a poorly disguised propaganda film commissioned by the US government.“We don’t see it as shameful to be promoting patriotism in our beloved country,” said CEO Kevin Tsujihara. “Chris Kyle is someone we can be proud of. He was a true American hero, one who was willing to give up all qualms over what is moral and good to mindlessly kill individuals his country told him were the baddies.”Director Clint Eastwood, however, denied that he knew anything about government intervention.“Propaganda?” he yelled. “What’s this propaganda?! To have pride in your country is propaganda?! To do what it takes to save the lives of American citizens is propaganda?! Those liberals will be the death of us all!”According to military sources, conscription to the armed forces has rocketed since the release of the obvious glorification of American interests.“Since the film’s release, we’ve seen a massive increase in young men and women signing up for the Navy. Millions of people, so that film is working. And it’s not just the poor and aimless who are choosing to fight any longer,” an anonymous source told news outlets. “Privileged rich boys are giving up their lives to do whatever the current authorities have deemed is necessary. It’s a pleasant break from what we’re used to.”While President Obama, along with other Democrat leaders, has distanced himself from reports on government involvement, certain Republicans have come out in defense and praise of the film that received six Oscar nominations.“In all my years,” said former Vice President Dick Cheney, breathing heavily. “In all my years, I’ve never heard such anti-patriotism as is coming from the liberal left. American Sniper is itself an all-American victory. What others may call propaganda, I call spreading truth. What’s next? They’ll start calling Uncle Sam propaganda, that’s what’s next!”",pol_s
"Paul Krugman Declares Personal Bankruptcy
Economist and columnist Paul Krugman declared personal bankruptcy today following a failed attempt to spend his way out of debt. In a Chapter 13 filing to the United States Bankruptcy Court in the Southern District of New York, lawyers for Krugman listed $7,346,000 in debts versus $33,000 in assets.n The majority of his debts are related to mortgage financing on a $8.7 million apartment in lower Manhattan, but the list also includes $621,537 in credit card debt and $33,642 in store financing at famed jeweler Tiffanys and Co. The filing says that Krugman got into credit card trouble in 2004 after racking up $84,000 in a single month on his American Express black card in pursuit of rare Portuguese wines and 19th century English cloth Rather than tighten his belt and pay the sums back, the pseudo-Keynesian economist decided to ""stimulate"" his way to a personal recovery by investing in expenses he hoped would one day boost his income. Between 2004 and 2007 Krugman splurged on expensive cars, clothes, and travel in hopes that the new lifestyle would convince his bosses at the New York Times to give him a giant raise. ""They say always dress for the job you want,"" Krugman explains. ""So I thought maybe if I showed up in $70,000 Alexander Amosu suits they would give me ownership of part of the company. If I had only been granted a sliver of the New York Times Co., I could have paid everything back."" Even after he realized an equity stake was not going to happen, Krugman continued to spend wildly hoping his bling and media appearances would increase demand for his personal brand and lift his book sales. His biggest mistake came in 2007, when at the height of the financial bubble he decided to invest in high-end real estate in New York City. His multi-million dollar apartment lost 40 percent of its value just months after its purchase, and has been underwater ever since. ""You'd think a Nobel Prize winning economist could recognize a housing bubble,"" says Herman Minsky, a retired television executive who purchased Krugman's home at a huge discount. ""But hey, I'm not complaining."" Krugman, a renowned trade economist, joined the New York Times as a columnist in 2000. Since the start of the financial crisis he as used the platform to argue vociferously for what he terms Keynesian deficit spending. However, Keynes did not advocate using debt financing to stimulate the economy. Rather, he argued that government should save in the good times and spend in the bad. Through his lawyer, Bertil Ohlin, Krugman explains that despite his travails with spending and debt in his personal finances, he stands by his pseudo-Keynesian policies. ""I still defend my analysis that on the macroeconomic level sovereign debt crises can be fixed by increasing government borrowing to lift aggregate demand. I admit, however, that on the microeconomic level this strategy has failed spectacularly."" ",pol_s
"Pretty Woman to be remade with Ryan Gosling as a male prostitute
After announcing a Ghostbusters remake with an all female-cast, producers have followed up with plans for a Pretty Woman remake starring Ryan Gosling as a prostitute. With gender reversal in lovingly remembered blockbusters now de rigueur in Hollywood, there has been fervent excitement at the prospect of Gosling taking on the role made famous by Julia Roberts in the 1990 smash hit. Speculation is rife that Helen Mirren has been signed to play the role of the millionaire business person who enjoys the company of prostitutes, previously portrayed by Richard Gere – though her publicist has yet to confirm the rumours. Movie fan Simon Williams told us, “I quite liked the original, but I’m also all for a bit of gender role reversal.” “The idea of an older woman on the big screen paying for sex would make quite a refreshing change.” “Though I’m not sure the remake will feature as heavily as the original does in my wank bank.” A spokesperson for Gosling told us, “Ryan is excited to take on this much-loved role, and he hopes to bring something fresh to the character, including a penis.” “The official title is still under wraps, obviously, but you wouldn’t be a million miles away with Pretty Man, Pretty Guy, or Pretty Boy.” Ryan Gosling fan Sharon Jones asked, “There will be nudity, right? Lots and lots of lovely nudity?” “And as a prostitute, he will be required to do lots of sexy things? And this will ultimately be available to me at home in high-definition?” “Good.”",ent_s
"CIA to make sweeping changes, focus more on cyber ops: agency chief
The Central Intelligence Agency will make one of the biggest overhauls in its nearly 70-year history, aimed in part at sharpening its focus on cyber operations and incorporating digital innovations, CIA director John Brennan said.Brennan said he is creating new units within the CIA, called ""mission centers,"" intended to concentrate the agency's focus on specific challenges or geographic areas, such as weapons proliferation or Africa.The CIA director said he also is establishing a new ""Directorate of Digital Innovation"" to lead efforts to track and take advantage of advances in cyber technology to gather intelligence.Historically, electronic eavesdroppers at the National Security Agency have been at the cutting edge of digital innovation within the U.S. government. But the CIA felt that it had to reorganize to keep up with the technological ""pace of change,"" as one official put it.Brennan said the new digital directorate will have equal status within the agency with four other directorates which have existed for years.""Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging"" in today's digital world, Brennan said. ""And so what we need to do as an agency is make sure we’re able to understand all of the aspects of that digital environment.""Brennan briefed a small group of reporters on the changes on Wednesday, on the condition they did not publish until he told CIA employees on Friday.Stepping up the CIA's expertise in cyberspace may help it counter technological innovations and sophisticated use of social media by militant groups such as Islamic State. It could also mitigate what U.S. officials have said is damage to intelligence gathering caused by former NSA and CIA contractor Edward Snowden.The 10 new ""mission centers"" will bring together CIA officers with expertise from across the agency's range of disciplines to concentrate on specific intelligence target areas or subject matter, Brennan said.Competition between spy agencies and between units within agencies has led to ""stove piping"" of information that should have been widely shared and to critical information falling through bureaucratic cracks, Brennan and other U.S. intelligence officials said.""I know there are seams right now, but what we’ve tried to do with these mission centers is cover the entire universe, regionally and functionally, and so something that’s going on in the world falls into one of those buckets,"" Brennan said.The CIA currently operates at least two such  interdisciplinary centers, covering counter-terrorism and counter-intelligence.Reaction to the CIA reorganization was mostly positive, although some veterans acknowledged it will likely prompt bureaucratic friction within the spy agency.""I think that this will strengthen the CIA significantly over time,"" former CIA acting director and deputy director Michael Morell said.""There are short term costs...A lot of things to work out,"" Morell added. ""And there are going to be...senior people with heartburn.""Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, praised Brennan's moves.""This reorganization was driven not by any institutional failure, but by the realization that the world has changed over the course of the last 70 years. In many ways, the Director’s proposal is long overdue,"" Burr said in a statement.Created in 1947, the CIA is divided into four major directorates. Two - the Directorate of Science and Technology, which among other activities invents spy gadgets, and the Directorate of Support, which handles administrative and logistical tasks - will retain their names.The Directorate of Intelligence will be renamed ""Directorate of Analysis"" to reflect its function as the home of agency experts who collate and analyze information from secret and open sources, Brennan said.The National Clandestine Service, home of front-line agency undercover ""case officers,"" who recruit spies and conduct covert actions, will be renamed Directorate of Operations, which is what it had been called for most of the agency's history.

"Elizabeth Hurley Says Hugh Grant Is ‘Annoying,’ ‘Grumpy’ -- But a ‘10’ in Bed
When it comes to shagging Hugh Grant and the royal family, Elizabeth Hurley does not plead the fifth! During a visit to Watch What Happens Live, the 49-year-old actress is grilled by host Andy Cohen on her ex-beau Hugh Grant. Hugh Grant Is 'Delighted' When He's Not Acting “He used to really annoy me. I love him but he’s very annoying,” Hurley said when asked about why the two broke up after 13 years together. “Did he annoy you when he was here?” “He was very cranky,” Cohen said in response to Hurley’s question. And in Cohen’s defense, Grant made a disgruntled appearance while on the show just weeks prior, looking very annoyed by the whole experience. “He is grumpy,” Hurley added, further dismantling the charming, romantic image fans have of the actor. Jon Stewart: Hugh Grant Is My Least Favorite Guest Ever However, when it came to his performance in bed, Hurley had nothing but praise: “10! I was with him for 13 years.” But the real test came when Cohen asked who among the royal family -- Prince Charles and his two sons William and Harry -- would Hurley “shag, marry, kill”? “I would marry Prince Charles, misbehave with Prince Harry,” Hurley said with a sudden realization about where that left William. “But I would have to kill Prince William.

"NASA's Dawn spacecraft reaches dwarf planet Ceres
NASA's Dawn spacecraft slipped into orbit around the dwarf planet Ceres Friday, setting the stage for unprecedented close-range observations of the largest body in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, an enigmatic world featuring heavily cratered terrain, smooth plains and mysterious bright spots. The solar-powered spacecraft, launched in 2007, was captured by Ceres' gravity at about 7:39 a.m. EST (GMT-5). An hour later, radio signals from Dawn confirmed the spacecraft was in good health as it moved into orbit and that's its low-thrust ion propulsion system was firing as expected. ""Since its discovery in 1801, Ceres was known as a planet, then an asteroid and later a dwarf planet,"" Marc Rayman, Dawn chief engineer and mission director, said in a NASA statement. ""Now, after a journey of 3.1 billion miles and 7.5 years, Dawn calls Ceres home."" Launched in 2007, Dawn flew past Mars for a velocity boosting gravity assist in 2009 and entered orbit around the asteroid Vesta in July 2011. After 14 months of unprecedented exploration, The spacecraft's ion propulsion system fired up to boost the probe out of orbit and onto icy Ceres, a 900-million-mile voyage that took two-and-a-half years to complete. At the moment of capture, Dawn was about 38,000 miles from Ceres. Over the next several weeks, the spacecraft will slowly spiral inward, reaching an altitude of about 8,400 miles by April 23 to begin close-range science operations. By the end of the year, it should be orbiting at an altitude of just 235 miles, a bit lower than the International Space Station orbits Earth. Unlike more typical planetary missions that use chemical rockets requiring make-or-break maneuvers to achieve orbit or descend to the surface, Dawn's arrival at Ceres was a much more sedate affair, thanks to its low-thrust ion engine and Newton's law of gravity.""If you had been in space watching the event ... it would not have looked much different from the 1,885 days of ion thrust that had preceded it,"" Rayman said in a blog posting. ""The spacecraft was perched atop its blue-green pillar of xenon ions, patiently changing its course, as it does for so much of quiet cruise."" The ion propulsion system uses electricity generated by two huge solar panels to accelerate xenon ions, imparting a gentle push that, over many months, can boost the spacecraft to enormous velocities. ""In this phase of the mission, the engine expends only a quarter of a pound (of xenon fuel) per day, or the equivalent of about 2.5 fluid ounces,"" Rayman wrote. ""So although the thrust is very efficient, it is also very gentle. If you hold a single sheet of paper in your hand, it will push on your hand harder than the ion engine pushes on the spacecraft at maximum thrust."" At the current throttle setting, he said, it would take Dawn ""almost 11 days to accelerate from zero to 60 mph."" ""That may not evoke the concept of a drag racer,"" he added. ""But in the zero-gravity, frictionless conditions of spaceflight, the effect of this whisper-like thrust can build up. Instead of thrusting for 11 days, if we thrust for a month, or a year, or as Dawn already has, for more than five years, we can achieve fantastically high velocity. Ion propulsion delivers acceleration with patience."" As a result, Dawn's arrival at Ceres was a decidedly low-key affair. There was no question the spacecraft would be captured by the dwarf planet's gravity, thanks to the months of thrusting it took to get to this point. ""So the flight team was not tense. They had no need to observe it or make a spectacle out of it,"" Rayman wrote. ""The drama is not in whether the mission will succeed or fail, in whether a single glitch could cause a catastrophic loss, in whether even a tiny mistake could spell doom. Rather, the drama is in the opportunity to unveil the wonderful secrets of a fascinating relict from the dawn of the solar system more than 4.5 billion years ago."" Dawn, the centerpiece of a $473 million mission, is the first spacecraft to orbit more than one body, the first to visit a dwarf planet -- Ceres -- and the first operational science probe to rely on ion propulsion. Discovered in 1801, Ceres was the first -- and largest -- body ever found in what is now known as the asteroid belt, a heavily cratered, roughly spherical world measuring 606 by 565 miles. ""One of the first things you notice is how round Ceres is,"" Carol Raymond, Dawn deputy principal investigator, said Monday. ""And Ceres' roundness is one of its planetary characteristics. We also know that Ceres is much lighter than the rocky planets and so we know it retained a lot of water and light volatile elements that were present in the solar nebula when Ceres was formed. In contrast, bodies like the moon and Vesta suffered melting from major impacts that caused the water and other light elements to boil away, ""leaving them dry and rocky,"" Raymond said. ""One of the prime motivations of the Dawn mission is to examine these building blocks of the planets, Vesta and Ceres, which are two intact proto-planets from the very dawn of the solar system,"" she said. ""They're literally fossils that we can investigate to really understand the processes that were going on at that time."" One major mystery is what might be the source of two brilliant spots of light seen in a crater on Ceres during Dawn's approach. ""Suffice it to say, these spots were extremely surprising to the team, and they have been puzzling to everybody who's seen them,"" Raymond said Monday. ""The team is really, really exited about this feature because it is unique in the solar system."" The bright spots presumably are reflected sunlight, possibly from ice or salt deposits that may have been uncovered by a recent impact. Other, less likely, scenarios include the action of ultra-low temperature ""cryovolcanism."" But for now, no one knows. And given their unusual brightness, interest is high. ""We will be revealing its true nature as we get closer and closer to the surface,"" Raymond said. ""So the mystery will be solved, but it is one that's got us on the edge of our seats.""",tech_t
"NBC Green-Lights ‘Friends: The Movie’, Entire Original Cast Expected To Return
NBC, the company behind one of the biggest sitcoms of all time, has announced that they have signed the entire original cast of Friends to a major motion picture deal.“For some reason, people just will not let this show die the death it so rightfully deserves,” said NBC Chairman Dennis Belding. “Even after a ten-year run, and then being off the air another ten years, the fans cannot get enough of Joey, Chandler, and whatever the other characters names were. Hell, even I’ve forgotten by this point.”Belding says that the slew of fan-made trailers for a film, some of them coming out better than actual Hollywood trailers, that have popped up on YouTube over the years, were one of the biggest reasons they knew that people were still clamoring for more Friends. “There is a fake trailer on YouTube right now with almost 10 million views. A fake trailer for a fake movie has 10 million views? How could we look at that, and sit back and not cash in?” said Belding. “Thankfully, since most of the original cast, with the exception of Jennifer Aniston, have been stuck in TV hell ever since Friends ended, it wasn’t too hard to get them to sign on.”So far, plot details are being kept under wraps, but executives at NBC say it’s because they have no idea how to make a “shoddy sitcom” into a “good movie.”“It’s true that we’re still working out the details of the plot, but I’m sure it will be something remotely decent. Hell, even if it’s not, it won’t matter. People will still flock to see it. The show was on for ten years, and was horrible the entire time. People will see any movie based on TV shows. Shit, they made two Sex In The City movies, for crying out loud. Two! And they were both abysmal.”“I’m so excited to get back together with everyone,” said Courtney Cox, who currently stars on TV show Cougar Town. “We all remained good friends over the years, no pun intended. The fans, they just wouldn’t let us die. Well, the fans and Entertainment Weekly. I swear, that magazine has had more cover-stories and multi-page articles about Friends since the show ended than they ever did when we were on. It’s kind of creepy, actually. Like an uncle who pats you on the bum, but then the hand just lingers, you know?”Insider reports indicate that the movie is being made for a fraction of the cost of the original series, because most of the cast have lost any and all star power since the show ended.“When the show was on, the cast members were all making over a million dollars per episode, each” said Belding. “Thankfully, no one cares about David Schwimmer anymore. God knows why they ever did care about David Schwimmer. Anyway, they’re all working for peanuts this time around. Well, except for Jennifer Aniston, of course.”The movie is being written by newcomer Alex Moore, a self-proclaimed Friends fanatic. Producers are still looking for a director, but reports say they are leaning towards McG (Terminator Salvation, Charlies Angels: Full Throttle).The fan-made trailer For FRIENDS: The Movie that triggered NBC executives to green-light the film  ",ent_s
"Horses Finally Admit They Fucking Hate Having People Ride On Their Backs
Horses have been helping and carrying around people for as long as anyone can remember.  They are a trusted ally who are always there to help haul a load, give a human a ride, or even run in a race so that wealthy assholes can dress up in ridiculous hats and bet mounds of their money for amusement. Horses love people. These are things we’ve always assumed.  Through the power of modern science and a very special animal psychic medium, we can actually find out what horses really think about all of these things today.  Dr. Shay Melbbat, who specifically specializes in dead horse communications, recently was able to channel the 1970 Kentucky Derby winner to ask a few questions.  Dust Commander was always known as a gentle horse but heed a warning that this dead horse is not happy.  He uses explicit language so do not read further if you are under 18 years old or easily offended. “Where in fuck did these human assholes get the idea that our mission in life should be to work for them?” asks Dust Commander.  “I’m already fucking dead and I made it to the promised land so I’m going to speak freely.  The only reason we try to win those goddamn races for humans is because we know if we achieve victory then those assholes will ‘put us out to pasture’ and let us have a lot of sex.  If humans used their little pea-sized brains, I think they might actually figure out that no animal wants to take another animal for a ride and get slapped in their ass by a big stick if we’re not going fast enough.  And what about my friends who are not blessed with the speed to race?  They hook them up to carriages so we can give humans a ‘tour of the city.’  They make us haul around big fat-assed lazy people who choose not to lift their fucking legs up and walk themselves.  We hate that bullshit.  And then they tie a fucking bag to our ass that we have to shit in so we don’t mess up their already fucked up streets?  You go shit in a bag.  And carry it around with you.  See how you like it, you asshole pricks.  I could go on and on Dr. Melbbat.  Really, I could.  On behalf of all horses, we appreciate you carrying forth this message for us.  Oh, just one last thing.  A sincere thanks to all you bastard humans who occasionally will grace us with an apple or a carrot.  Then right back to the nasty dried up grass that you feed us.  We don’t like that garbage.  Ever thought about throwing down a bucket of steak and potatoes for us?  Fuck no you haven’t because you’re pompous assholes.  Don’t mistake our kindness for anything more than a compliant prisoner.  We wish we had some special talent to kill all of you.  But we don’t.  Why don’t you try taming some lions and riding them for awhile you fucktards?  We’d love to see how that works out for you.” Dr. Melbbat slipped into a coma almost immediately after this message from the other side was transmitted to him.  Doctors believe the passion and gravity of Dust Commander’s rant was just too much for Melbbat to handle.  He has been viewed sounding a whinny or a neigh during quickly passing convulsions but doctor’s believe Melbbat will not ever return to life as he once knew it.  Doctor’s also believe it is the first documented case of a dead horse killing a living human.  It’s likely not the last.",tech_s
"Government To Reduce Food Stamp Allowance Of Overweight Recipients
 The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which Americans commonly refer to as the ‘Food Stamp Program’, has voted to reduce the monthly allowance of obese welfare recipients, according to body weight according to SNAP spokesperson Winston C. Douglas in an announcement earlier today.Douglas said that after a vote was brought to the SNAP board of directors, that the group voted unanimously in support of the proposed measure in an attempt to fight obesity in the United States.“An alarming statistic was brought to the board which stated that over fifty-percent of SNAP benefit recipients are grossly overweight, many of which are clinically considered obese. This, of course is major cause for concern with how the program is operated” Douglas said.All SNAP recipients, including all who live in the household, will be ordered to take a physical as part of the new plan. Depending on results, funding could be drastically reduced for those who are overweight. A measure many suggest is long overdue, including New Jersey governor Chris Christie.“I have to work in order to overeat,” the hefty governor said when asked about the new measure. “It’s a problem when the government is giving people money to sit on their lazy butts and just eat all day. It is about time something is done about this plague of people abusing the accessibility of welfare benefits.”There are also those who think it is highly inappropriate to require welfare recipients to take a physical in order to receive their monthly allowance, such as Shantae Johnson, 32, of Cleveland, Ohio.“Who the hell they think they are? Just because we poor means we can’t be fat? I think it’s wrong, and we deserve to get what is owed to us no matter how we look! People pay taxes for us to have that money to get whatever food we damn well please,” Johnson said angrily. “This is an outrage and we not gonna put up with the harassment! I don’t see them harassing rich people who are fat!”",pol_s
"New HBO series ‘Boobs and Swearing’ a massive hit
HBO’s latest hit TV show, ‘Boobs and Swearing’ has taken the UK by storm, with over nine million people tuning in to the first episode. “We were confident ‘Boobs and Swearing’ would be a hit.” said Andrew Costello, the UK born director of the series. “The thing with a modern, sophisticated television audience is that they’re not shocked by boobs and swearing on TV anymore, and having that freedom to be open about boobs and swearing is really beneficial to a show like ‘Boobs and Swearing’.” The programme’s plot is largely irrelevant explains screenwriter Stephen Emmsworth. “Yeah, having a meaningless plot is great for me as a writer because it gives me the opportunity to really express myself with extended scenes of boobs and swearing.” ‘Boobs and Swearing’ fan Simon Williams from Bracknell was very excited by the first episode. “Oh I loved it!” he told us. “I mean I wasn’t bothered about the story, acting or writing, but I’ll definitely be coming back for more ‘Boobs and Swearing’ next week.” But TV critic Marjorie Winterbottom was less impressed. “I’m no prude,” she said, “but frankly I was shocked; ‘Boobs and Swearing’ does seem to feature a great deal more boobs and swearing than I was expecting.” The dominance of ‘Boobs and Swearing’ in the TV schedule is expected to continue right up until January when HBO’s new show ‘Vaginas and guns’ arrives.",ent_s
"Chinese lunar rover finds no evidence of American moon landings
A report from the Chinese state news agency Xinhua has confirmed that China’s mission to the moon hasn’t found a single scrap of evidence that Americans were ever there. Photographs of the lunar surface taken while the ‘Jade Rabbit’ probe was in orbit and further investigations on the ground have now been analysed and show that areas where US landings were thought to have taken place reveal a surface untouched by man, and no sign of any golf activity whatsoever. ‘They were never there at all,’ said baffled Chinese Foreign Minster, Wang Yi, ‘All those conspiracy theories about Americans making stuff up to make themselves look good turn out to be true. And we would never have known if it weren’t for the glorious People’s Lunar probe of China re-writing history and putting the record straight.’ The findings were even more disappointing for the scientists who created the probe. They had equipped Jade Rabbit with special cutting tools for shredding any American flags it found and replacing them with China’s own. Special legs were also fitted so that the rover could sidle up to remnants of any American spacecraft and kick it and kick it and kick it in the most contemptuous manner possible. ‘We thought, well, what were they going to do, they’d have to send a mission to go back and replant them, surely?’ Mr Yi added. ‘Our policy was simple: all they would have to do was ask us to lend them the money to do it. And then we’d say no. Ha ha ha ha ha! Pig dogs! It’s such a shame that we won’t now get the chance to HUMILIATE them again.’ The Chinese lunar programme is set to accelerate, Mr Yi confirmed. ‘We are building a space centre in the Gobi desert, with a mission control room, astronaut training and a massive sound stage made to look like the moon from where our fake landing will be broadcast to the world in 2016,’ he stated, completely oblivious to the fact that he may have given too much away and will probably be shot in the morning. White House press secretary Jay Carney refused to comment, but was heard muttering under his breath that ‘those bastards will copy anything’.",tech_s
"Oregon attorney general opens probe into Governor Kitzhaber
Oregon's attorney general is investigating allegations surrounding Governor John Kitzhaber and his fiancÃ©e about a potential conflict of interest between her role in the governor's office and her private consulting business.Â Democrat Kitzhaber, in a letter dated Monday, asked Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum, also a Democrat, to investigate the matter. The attorney general responded that a probe was already under way.""My office has already opened an investigation into this matter. I appreciate your intent to fully cooperate,â€ Rosenblum said in a letter to the governor.Â  Kitzhaber, who was re-elected to an unprecedented fourth term in November, has been dogged for months by mounting allegations that fiancÃ©e Cylvia Hayes used her role in his office for personal gain. It was not immediately clear when Rosenblum, who last week characterized the allegations against the governor as troubling, had opened the investigation. Neither her office nor the governor's would respond beyond the letters.     The probe by the attorney general's office appeared to be in addition to a review by the state's ethics commission of  whether Hayesâ€™ acceptance of consulting contracts may have violated state ethics rules.Â     The state's flagship newspaper, The Oregonian, last week called on Kitzhaber, whom it had endorsed for re-election last year, to resign. Kitzhaber has said he has no plans to step down, and promised to cooperate with the attorney general's probe.""I deeply regret that this situation has become a distraction from the important work of our state and look forward to your review and its conclusions,""Â he said in the letter. Adding to woes facing the governor, media reports last week revealed that Hayes received $118,000 in previously undisclosed consulting fees in 2011 and 2012 from the Washington-based Clean Economy Development Center while advising the governor on energy policy.Kitzhaber did not disclose Hayesâ€™ income from the Clean Economy group on his annual economic interest statements despite disclosing other fees she had received via consulting contracts. He has said the couple did not see it as a potential conflict of interest and therefore did not feel it had to be reported.He recently announced Hayes will no longer have a policy role in his office.Â ",pol_t
"Xiaomi to launch Mi store in US -- but no phones for now
Chinese smartphone maker Xiaomi is bringing its products to the US, but perhaps not the ones consumers might clamor for most. The company announced Thursday at a fireside chat with press here that it will be launching its online Mi store in US, but it will not carry any phones in the Mi line, Mi Note or Redmi line of smartphones, nor its Mi Pad tablet. Instead, Xiaomi will sell its lesser-known ancillary products such as headphones and its Mi Band wearable fitness tracker.An online store signifies the first step towards its eagerly anticipated entry into the US market. While not a household name, Xiaomi has steadily built up its reputation among the tech savvy as ""the Apple of China"" with affordable and slick-designed devices packed with high-end components, all with price tags that are sometimes half that of its competitors' products. Further adding to the hype is its position as the world's most valuable startup with a valuation of more than $45 billion. But the Western markets represent a different beast -- one where consumers gravitate to the biggest names like Apple and Samsung.Hugo Barra, a former Google executive who left the search company to join Xiaomi as vice president of international operations in 2013, said the company wants to be calculated and careful when bringing its flagship products to new markets. It's a now-recurring theme for the start-up that considers itself an Internet services company -- not just a handset maker. ""The amount of effort required to bring those products [phones and tablets] to market is significant. We just have to move at the right pace,"" Barra told the audience. ""So we're accelerating our entry in a sense by bringing simpler products."" Barra cited factors like manufacturing, packaging, regulations and the software hurdles with a language gap for the slow arrival of Xiaomi phones in Western markets.Xiaomi is growing at an incredible pace, having amassed more than 100 million users of its MIUI operating system, a variant of Google's Android OS, in just four and a half years since its August 2010 founding. Xiaomi is now the leading seller of smartphones in China and accounted for five out of every eight Android phone activations in the last month, the company said, thanks to large followings in developing markets like India, Malaysia and Indonesia. It's the world's sixth largest smartphone manufacturer, according to research firm TrendForce, although its upward trajectory suggest it'll likely move up the ranks throughout the year. The pace of that growth has many wondering when Xiaomi will expand to markets where Apple and Samsung have captured large percentages of the market. Xiaomi prefers to take its time. Xiaomi's strategy of launching an online store echoes similar plays run by fellow Chinese manufacturers such as Huawei and Alcatel. While these companies supply cheaper smartphones to prepaid customers through their carrier relationships, they are attempting to push their higher end flagship smartphones directly to consumers through their own online presence. Xiaomi, however, is moving even more gingerly, holding off on its marquee smartphone products for now.",tech_t
"Critics Confirm Charlie Sheen’s Return To Two and A Half Men
During an interview with Ellen DeGeneres last Friday, Ashton Kutcher didn’t have to say anything to prove that Two and a Half Men producer Chuck Lorre plans on rehiring Charlie Sheen to the cast of the show. Rumors have swirled around the internet for months, and there is now finally confirmation of Sheen’s long awaited return to the show. Sheen was fired from Two and a Half Men in 2011, after making controversial public rants against Producer Lorre. He eventually sued CBS, the Warner Bros Studio, and Lorre himself for his dismissal from the show. His character, Charlie Harper, was presumed dead in the storyline, as Lorre had to devise a quick way to write the character out; though fans never really saw proof of the character’s demise. He has told TV Guide that he is up for returning to the long-running series, and other sources say he’s admitted that he actually is returning. Jon Cryer, who portrays Sheen’s younger brother Alan Harper in the show, reportedly expressed much excitement about Sheen’s return, stating he “literally cannot wait” to “reunite with Sheen” and “begin filming the final episode”. Critics report that Lorre plans on reintroducing Sheen into the cast for the final episode of the series, further confirming Cryer’s allegations. Rumor states that the production team has decided that the character’s death never occurred; that he was only presumed to be dead by the other characters, yet has been alive the throughout the past three years. While it sounds a bit like how a soap opera would play out, CBS spokesperson Ameera Lindley says the strategy “makes sense”, as it is incredibly difficult to bring people back from the dead on television. While AMC’s The Walking Dead did it with the character of Beth Greene, it’s a bit more difficult to pull off within a half hour prime-time family show. The facts are, that fans never saw anything that proved the death of Charlie Harper. The only thing that hinted at the character’s death within the show was a mock-funeral, and some ill-fated dialogue to remind us that he once existed. Producers have poorly attempted to bring back the memory of Charlie by writing his supposed-daughter into the cast, however, fans have seen it as a major fail. National Report Staff attempted to reach out to Sheen personally for comment; his response? “Winning!” Two and a Half Men fans may just have to be patient, and await what Charlie Sheen does next.

A butterfly headdress, feathered gowns and garments crafted from horns, hair and seashells went on display in London this week in a exhibition celebrating the work of the late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen.McQueen was famous for his daring creations and avant-garde fashion shows which drew upon themes of nature, history, romance and tragedy.Trained as apprentice on London's Savile Row, the designer rose from an east end London boyhood to become of the world's leading talents in fashion before he took his own life five years ago.More than 240 pieces of McQueen's work feature in the exhibition at London's Victoria and Albert Museum, including dresses made from feathers and hand painted glass, as well as intricately embroidered kimonos and lace-covered antlers.It was the designer's attention to detail that stood out for curator Claire Wilcox, who helped bring the show to London.""McQueen's collections were so enthralling and yet at the same time each garment was so beautifully crafted -- so you have this extreme attention to detail, fastidious tailoring, beautiful embellishments and incorporation of all sorts of different materials,"" she told Reuters.Divided into 10 different rooms, the exhibition takes visitors on a journey through the designer's work, including videos of his shows and special pieces from his archive.In one room, the Cabinet of Curiosities, 120 garments and accessories can be seen, including his signature ""Armadillo"" shoes, a number of headdresses by his friend and collaborator Philip Treacy and a white strapless gown that was spray-painted by robots in one of his iconic shows.The exhibition, which was originally shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, is a homecoming for the designer whose earlier work was heavily influenced heavily by London where he grew up and based his label.McQueen was known for his ability to shock and his autumn/winter 1995 collection ""Highland Rape"" which featured disheveled looking models in torn clothing was considered a classic example.""He did court controversy and he wanted to get people's attention with his shows,"" said Wilcox.""There is no doubt that was an element of fearless, the bravado, the East End boy -- all of these elements but I think people are just struck with admiration for his creativity ... and his artistry,"" she added.Alexander McQueen: Savage Beauty opens on Mar. 14 and will run until Aug. 2.",ent_t
